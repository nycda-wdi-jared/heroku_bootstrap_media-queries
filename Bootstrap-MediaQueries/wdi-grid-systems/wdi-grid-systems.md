# What is a grid system?
### (as it relates to CSS + web design)

- Rather than arbitrarily deciding how large content blocks on a web page should be, have them conform to a set width

- Going further, instead of a set width for each block, decide on a width unit and make certain blocks x number of that unit wide

- Makes for more symmetrical designs and easier to maintain, more easily responsive code

# Using Bootstrap's grid system

- Bootstrap is a full-featured front end CSS framework

- It is written in LESS, a higher-level version of CSS that gets compiled down to CSS

- To use Bootstrap, you include their library in the `<head>` section of your webpage

- Different features of the library are accessed using class names like `.row` for your elements

# Using Bootstrap's Grid System
## according to the official docs at [getboostrap.com/css](getboostrap.com/css)


- Rows must be placed within a .container (fixed-width) or .container-fluid (full-width) for proper alignment and padding.

- Use rows to create horizontal groups of columns.

- Content should be placed within columns, and only columns may be immediate children of rows.

# Using Bootstrap's Grid System
## according to the official docs at [getboostrap.com/css](getboostrap.com/css)

- Predefined grid classes like `.row` and `.col-xs-4` are available for quickly making grid layouts. 

- Columns create gutters (gaps between column content) via padding. That padding is offset in rows for the first and last column via negative margin on `.rows`

- Grid columns are created by specifying the number of twelve available columns you wish to span. For example, three equal columns would use three `.col-xs-4`

</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-4">.col-md-4</div>
  <div class="col-md-4">.col-md-4</div>
  <div class="col-md-4">.col-md-4</div>
