# What is Bootstrap

Bootstrap is a front-end framework.

__Front-End__: All files that are executed on the 'client' machine. 
This includes: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

__Framework__: The supporting structure of an application

It is built and maintained by Twitter.

# Why use a framework?


- Rapid application development (You can build things faster)
- Work more efficiently with other developers
- Don't reinvent the wheel

# What does Bootstrap give us?

- A grid system
- Great looking default styles
- JavaScript components: sliders, lightboxes, responsive navigation etc.
- CSS components: thumbnails, progress bars, alerts etc.
